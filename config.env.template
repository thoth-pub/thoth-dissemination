# Crossref user credentials
# Separate credentials must be provided for each publisher whose works are to be submitted.
# Each set of credentials must be given in the format below, i.e. with the
# Thoth publisher ID suffixed (omitting the square brackets).
# Note that the hyphens (-) in the Thoth publisher ID must be replaced
# with underscores (_). This is to allow compatibility with GitHub Actions,
# and make it easier to provide credentials as inline environment variables
# (as env vars with names containing hyphens require use of `env` program).
